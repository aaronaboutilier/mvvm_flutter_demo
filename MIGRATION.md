## Migration and evolution strategies

**Incremental migration approach** minimizes risk through phased implementation. Phase 1 establishes core architecture and dependency injection. Phase 2 migrates features individually to clean architecture. Phase 3 adds enterprise features like i18n and accessibility. Phase 4 implements advanced features and optimizations.

**Strangler Fig pattern** enables gradual migration by wrapping legacy services with clean architecture interfaces. Feature flags control whether to use legacy or new implementations, allowing safe rollback if issues arise.

**Backwards compatibility strategies** ensure smooth transitions through versioned APIs, graceful degradation for missing features, and migration utilities for data format changes.

**Database migration patterns** handle schema evolution with proper versioning and migration scripts. Tools like Floor or Drift provide structured migration frameworks for SQLite databases.

**Code generation for migration** automates repetitive migration tasks like generating repository interfaces, implementing dependency injection configurations, and creating test scaffolding.

## Implementation roadmap

**Phase 1: Architecture Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Establish core clean architecture structure
- Implement dependency injection with GetIt and Injectable  
- Set up testing framework and CI/CD pipeline
- Create basic error handling and logging infrastructure

**Phase 2: Core Enterprise Features (Weeks 3-6)**
- Implement internationalization framework with ARB files
- Add accessibility services and semantic data models
- Create basic theming system with design tokens
- Establish configuration management for environments

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-10)**
- Add white labeling support with build variants or modules
- Implement feature flag system with remote configuration
- Create comprehensive analytics and performance monitoring
- Add offline-first capabilities with local data sync

**Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (Weeks 11-12)**
- Implement comprehensive test suites for all features
- Optimize performance with caching and lazy loading
- Add automation for accessibility and internationalization testing
- Create documentation and team training materials
